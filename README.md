# furcate
[ verb fur-keyt ] _to form a fork; branch._

When you want to enable your users to "branch" and "merge" data the same way you 
branch and merge code, then **furcate** is for you. It replaces `ActiveRecord::Base` 
on your models, storing each change to the model in a separate row in the database. 
Changes are recorded as commits. Together they form snapshots of the data your users
interact with. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'furcate'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install furcate

## Usage

```ruby
require 'furcate'

class Team < Furcate::Leaf
end
```

```ruby
team = Team.create("The A Team") 

#switch to a new limb and remove the team
Furcate.create_and_switch_to_limb("cleanup branch")
team.delete

#switch back to the main limb, team is restored
Furcate.switch_to_limb("main")
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
